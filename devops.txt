1)Devops:
=======
1)Define DevOps?
DevOps is not a tool or technology; it is an approach or culture that makes things better.
It also describes how it can be used to make development and operations teams efficient and effective in order to make time to market faster by improving culture. It also explains key concepts essential for evolving DevOps culture.

2)DEVOPS MOVEMENT?
The following sequence of events takes place when any new feature is implemented, or bug fixed:
1.The development team writes code to implement a new feature or fix a bug. This new code is deployed to the development environment and generally tested by the development team.
2.The new code is deployed to the QA environment, where it is verified by the testing team.
3.The code is then provided to the operations team for deploying it to the production environment.
4.The operations team is responsible for managing and maintaining the code.

3)CHALLANGES FOR OPERATIONS TEAM?
Challenges for the operations team:
Resource contention: It's difficult to handle increasing resource demands
Redesigning or tweaking: This is needed to run the application in the production environment
Diagnosing and rectifying: They are supposed to diagnose and rectify issues after application deployment in isolation

4. CHALLENGES FOR DEVELOPMENT TEAM?
Challenges for the development team:
>>The competitive market creates on-time delivery pressure.
>>They have to take care of production-ready code management and new feature implementation.
>>The release cycle is often long and hence the development team has to make assumptions before the application deployment finally takes place. In such a scenario, it takes more time to fix the issues that occurred during deployment in the staging or production environment.

5.WATERFALL MODEL:
ADVANTAGES:
>>It has its advantages, as follows:
>>Easy to understand
>>Easy to manage—the input and output of each phase is defined 
>>Sequential process—order is maintained
>>Better control
DISADVANTAGES:
>>No revision
>>No outcome or application package until all phases are completed
>>Not possible to integrate feedback until all phases are completed 
>>Not suitable for changing requirements
>>Not suitable for long-term and complex projects

6.AGILE MODEL
Inefficient estimation, long time to market, and other issues led to a change in the waterfall model, resulting in the agile model. Agile development or the agile methodology is a method of building an application by empowering individuals and encouraging interactions, giving importance to working software, customer collaboration—using feedback for improvement in subsequent steps—and responding to change in an efficient manner. It emphasizes customer satisfaction through continuous delivery in small interactions for specific features in short timelines or sprints.

7.WHY DEVOPS?
>>DevOps is effective because of new methodologies, automation tools, agile resources of cloud service providers, and other disruptive innovations, practices, and technologies. However, it is not only about tools and technology-DevOps is more about culture than tools or technology alone.
>>There is an urgent need of a huge change in the way development and operations teams collaborate and communicate. Organizations need to have a change in culture and have long term business goals that include DevOps in their vision. It is important to establish the pain points and obstacles experienced by different teams or business units and use that knowledge for refining business strategy and fixing goals.
>>The end objective of the DevOps culture is continuous improvement. We learn from our mistakes, and it becomes experience. Experience helps us identify robust design patterns and minimize errors in processes. This leads to an enhancement of productivity, and hence, we achieve new heights with continuous innovations.

8.BENIFTS OF DEVOPS?
>Automation to minimize manual , time consuming process to improve end-user satisfaction.
>Automated deployments and standardi zed configuration management for different envi ronments.
>Business andiT col laboration to ensure agility.
>Faster delivery ofnew features or resolution of issues.
>High-level of quality for feature/function delivery
>Better managenement of underlying business processess
>Continuous innovation because of continous development of new ideas
>Better Redundancy/ Failover/ Quick Recovery
>Collaboration,Management, and security for the complete application developmeny lifecycle management.
>Efficient use of resources with imrpoved visibility,transparency into technology costs using Cloyd resources.
